# League-of-Statistics_v2
This project is an upgraded version of [League-of-Statistics_v1](https://github.com/domstrevino/League-of-Statistics_v1).

Formerly built using Windows Forms, this project was refactored in ASP.NET Razor Pages. Due to the HTML Nodes that were used to web scrape data, it no longer functions properly.

The goal of this project is to create a functioning application once again that will not fail in the future.
